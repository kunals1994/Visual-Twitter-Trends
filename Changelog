Version alpha-0.2.4, 23 June 2008 (r1951)
* Lots of performance improvements, and a new section in the user's guide
  about performance tuning.
* New edge attributes: arrow_position, arrow_length, arrow_radius, 
  arrow_reverse
* New edge stroke kind: "none", does not draw the edge, but still draws
  decorations (i.e. arrowhead and label)
* New examples: arrows.py, routing.py
* Bug fix: vertex "visible" attribute not handled properly

Version alpha-0.2.3, 29 May 2008
* Better Python API: examples/Python/ubigraph_example.py
* Reduced dependency on shared libraries

Version alpha-0.2.2, 28 May 2008
* XMLRPC callbacks on left double-click; see Python/callback.py
  and Python/callback_webcrawler.py
* New platforms supported: Mac OS X PowerPC, Ubuntu 6.06
* arrowheads are back (will be more customizable in future)
* New API methods: new_vertex_style_w_id(s,parent) and 
  new_edge_style_w_id(s,parent)
* Performance and numeric-stability improvements
* Fullscreen mode (right-mouse button menu)
* Autozoom (disable via right-mouse button menu if it annoys)
* Toggle labels: right-mouse button menu, or press 'l' or 'L'
* Added 'oriented' attribute for edges: see e.g. Python/tree.py
* New example: Python/multiedge.py
* Ruby interface (rubigraph) by mootoh
* Higher rate of XMLRPC requests processed without reducing the framerate
* Improved error reporting; use ubigraph_server -quiet to suppress warnings
* Brought C API up to date
* API now guarantees that generated id's are in the range 0x40000000-0x7fffffff.
* Bug fix: jittery vertices caused by threading issues
* Bug fix: colors with uppercase hex digits 
* Bug fix: segfault due to non-threadsafe code on big graphs (#768202)
* Bug fix: style changes that affect layout now exit idle mode

Version alpha-0.2.1, 23 May 2008
* Built-in colour palette
* Automatic control of shapedetail to maintain frame rate
* Vertices now have 'visible' attribute
* Bug fix: jitter caused by bug in spline edges
* Bug fix: spacetree bug that caused stack overflows in some 
  circumstances (#768202)
* Bug fix: going idle while zooming

Version alpha-0.2, 22 May 2008
* Performance improvements
* Spline edges: set_edge_attribute(e, "spline", "true")
* Edge strokes: set_edge_attribute(e, "stroke", "dotted"/"dashed"/"solid")
* Higher rate of XMLRPC requests can be handled (i.e., graph can be
  updated faster).
* Bug fix (#104168,#270723,#356196): Edge labels, width work correctly
* Bug fix (#270099): Edge id's were not released when vertices removed
