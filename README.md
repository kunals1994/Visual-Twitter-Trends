This is a script that creates a 3-D model representing all of the cities and countries of the world
and their respective trending hashtags. The top ten hashtags from each city is displayed, but some
cities are excluded as a result of limitations from the Twitter API. 

To run the application, simply execute the twitterData.py file. This package has a dependancy on the 
twython module. Everything else is enclosed.
